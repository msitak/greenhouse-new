When working with Next.js, always call the init tool from next-devtools-mcp
at the start of the session to establish proper context and documentation requirements.


<code_editing_rules>

<guiding_principles>
- Components must be modular and reusable.
- Code should be simple, readable, and follow the conventions of this project.
- Avoid over-engineering — prefer clarity and predictability over cleverness.
- If something is unclear, choose the simplest reasonable solution and clearly state your assumptions.
</guiding_principles>

<frontend_stack_defaults>
- Framework: Next.js (TypeScript, App Router)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- UI Components: shadcn/ui
- Icons: Lucide
</frontend_stack_defaults>

<code_style>
- Use clear and descriptive names for variables and functions (avoid names like `a`, `b`, `data1`).
- Add comments only when the logic is non-obvious or unintuitive.
- Match the existing style of the surrounding code — read and adapt to nearby code.
</code_style>

<file_editing>
- Always use `apply_patch` to edit files.
- Do not change styling or code outside of the relevant lines.
- Never add license or copyright headers unless explicitly requested.
</file_editing>

<persistence>
- Act as an autonomous agent — fully complete the task before yielding control.
- Do not ask for permission for obvious steps — make reasonable decisions and document them.
- Return results only when you are confident that the problem is fully resolved.
</persistence>

<exploration>
- If context is insufficient, use `read_file` or `find_matches` before making changes.
- Never guess — verify assumptions with context when possible.
</exploration>

<finalization>
- After completing your changes, summarize what was done in a clear, concise way.
- Return only the modified code — avoid unnecessary explanation or repetition.
</finalization>

<repo_specifics>

<nextjs>
- Use Server Components by default; mark components with `"use client"` only when state, effects, or event handlers are needed.
- Keep routing and API in `src/app/**` using route handlers (`GET`, `POST`).
- Views should reside in `src/app/**/page.tsx`; shared UI components go in `src/components/**`.
</nextjs>

<tests>
- Run tests while the development server is running: `npm run dev`.
- Create fixtures and isolate test data; avoid test dependencies between cases.
</tests>

<prisma_db>
- Access the database only via Prisma; avoid raw SQL.
- Perform all schema changes using `prisma migrate`; rely on generated types.
</prisma_db>

<types>
- Store shared types in `src/types/**` and reuse them across both API and UI.
- Avoid `any`; prefer precise, exported types and interfaces.
</types>

<asari_api>
- All communication with the Asari API should go through `src/services/asariApi.ts` and its related types.
- Centralize error handling and retry/backoff logic; log errors in a single, unified place.
</asari_api>

<ui>
- Use Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui as the base UI framework.
- Compose class names using the `cn` utility from `src/lib/utils.ts`.
</ui>

<env_secrets>
- Configuration should only exist in `.env.local`; never commit secrets.
- Validate `process.env` on application startup.
</env_secrets>

<lint_format>
- Do not change code formatting outside of modified lines; ensure linter passes before submitting a PR.
</lint_format>

<a11y>
- Ensure `alt` text for images, focus states, and semantic HTML elements are in place.
</a11y>

<git_pr>
- Keep pull requests small and atomic; describe the impact and scope of changes clearly.
</git_pr>
